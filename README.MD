# Rock Paper Scissors - A medieval themed RPS game

This game is just a very convoluted RPS game made for The Odin Project. For that reason here is a small guide to make sure you understand correctly.

## Play at: https://rps.jarvis09.com

## How to use

There are two play modes: infinite mode and trial mode (which basically means that you are playing 5 games and at the end either you or the computer wins).

To play in infinite mode just select the "One" button on the settings section (left) and click the "Begin Anew" button. You can then prosceed to click on rock, paper or scissors until the heat death of the Universe.

To play in Trial mode select either the "Five" or set a custom amount in the field under (make sure to press the "Offer thy choice" button afterwards). After you select your amount of trials it should show up on the "Begin anew" button which you have to press to start a new Trial. At the end you'll see under the RPS buttons wether you won, tied or lost. A new trial with the same amount of rounds will automatically start.

TL;DR: press "one" and "begin anew" to play indefinitely, set any other number to play in trials mode. **make sure to press the "offer thy choice" if you used a custom number and "begin anew" after setting your number**.

This game also has statistics, you can track your amount of wins, defeats and ties and get your winning percentage. This data is lost when you reload the page or click the "Erase thy tally" button

**WARNING: I highly recommend not to look at the JavaScript code. It's absolutely awful (plus you'll uncover my crypto miner uh)**
